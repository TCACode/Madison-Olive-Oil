					What is Madison Olive Oil about?
				</h2>
        In 2013, our family visited an olive oil store for the first time. We realized that we had never been exposed to truly fresh olive oil.  The concept of eating healthy has always been important to us, but the olive oils that we had previously bought at our local grocers could not come close to the flavor and richness of these genuinely fresh oils. This is how Madison Olive Oil was born, out of our desire to make available the freshest and healthiest olive oils and vinegars to our community.

Extra Virgin Olive oil is the fruit juice of first pressed olives. Our standards for EVOO far exceed the very basic standards set by the International Olive Oil Council and FDA. Our oils are imported from the Northern and Southern Hemispheres at optimal harvest times to provide our customers with only the freshest oils year round. This results in a superior quality oil with higher health benefits.
